Here's a little blurb about me that was written before ChatGBT could make you think I'm cool! 
Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer. For my current role, I specialize in developing powerful libraries for other engineers to build applications on. 
I love working in spaces that thrive on innovation and creativity. 
I value keen, quality-driven collaboration with other passionate engineers to solve difficult problems. 
Iâ€™m skilled in React, Angular, Rails, Express, Ruby, JavaScript, and Java. 
In my free time, I enjoy writing short passages, reading fiction novels, and mentoring people that aspire to break into technology.
